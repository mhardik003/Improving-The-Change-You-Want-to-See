# Computer Vision Project

This project was an extension of the [The Change You Want to See](https://github.com/ragavsachdeva/The-Change-You-Want-to-See) WACV 2023 paper by Raghav Sachdeva & Andrew Zisserman where we tried to make changes in order to improve the results claimed by the paper by trying techniques as proposed in the [Proposal.pdf](Proposal.pdf).

The results to the project and the changes we made can we found at this [W&B link](https://wandb.ai/wb-team-hardik/cyws?nw=nwusermhardik003).
